"""Replay Silver (and Gold) from Bronze — no FRED calls.

Bronze retains every raw API payload verbatim (the system of record), so Silver
and Gold can always be re-derived from it. This is the tool to run after fixing
a transform/normalization bug, or to backfill a table that was dropped: it reads
archived payloads in ingestion order and re-MERGEs them, so the reconstruction
is deterministic and idempotent.
