"""Gold layer: analytics-ready feature tables and point-in-time views.

Gold is rebuilt from Silver with pure SQL so it stays reproducible and cheap to
reason about:

  * ``gold.fred_latest_observation`` — one row per (series, date) at its latest
    revision (the "as revised today" view).
  * ``gold.fred_point_in_time``       — full vintage history for ALFRED-style
    "what was known on date X" queries.
  * ``gold.fred_macro_feature_daily``  — a daily, forward-filled feature matrix
    suitable for optimizer inputs and ML.

The SQL templates live here so the orchestrator can refresh Gold in one call;
equivalent DDL/DML also ships in ``sql/50_gold.sql`` and ``sql/60_views.sql``.
