"""Send the stage-tracking summary email for a run.

The entry point is :func:`send_run_alert`, which the pipeline calls once at the
end of a run. It decides whether to send (policy + environment + recipients),
renders both body parts, and hands the result to whichever transport the config
names.

**Alerting never fails a run.** Every exception is caught and logged. A pipeline
that ingested 2,800 series correctly must not be reported as failed because a
mail server was briefly unreachable — and the operator still gets the summary in
the log via the console transport.

The webhook notifier in :mod:`fred_pipeline.governance.notify` is unchanged and
still fires independently; this is an additional channel with a richer payload,
not a replacement.
